Swifty Beams is an entry for the 2014 Flappy Jam, written in JavaScript. Run as quickly as you can in an underground laboratory, avoiding deadly laser beams as you go.

Swifty Beams placed 9th out of almost 800 entries. All work is my own, from the design to the game engine to the game code to the art assets to the sound.
