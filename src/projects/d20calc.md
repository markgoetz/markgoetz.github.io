D20calc.com is a webapp used to see the success percentage of accomplishing a skill check in RPG systems that use a D20, such as Dungeons & Dragons and Pathfinder.  It includes support for advantage / disadvantage, and automatic successes or failures on criticals.

D20calc.com was built in 2019 using Vue, Sass, and HTML 5, with more of a focus on accessible markup.
