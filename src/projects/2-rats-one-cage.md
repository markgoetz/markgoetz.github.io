2 Rats 1 Cage is a puzzle game made for the 2015 Global Game Jam, taking place over 48 hours. You are a lab rat in possession of a powerful brain implant that lets you control other rats. Use your unique abilities to escape the maze!

I was on a team of six people, and I did most of the game programming with C# and Unity. I worked closely with our team to advise on the technical feasibility of ideas, as well as to ensure that the direction was being followed. I also integrated art and audio assets into the game.
