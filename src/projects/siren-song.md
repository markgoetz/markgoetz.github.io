Siren Song is an arcade game created for the 48-hour Ludum Dare game jam in 2014, using JavaScript. Play as an ancient Greek sea serpent who lures sailors to death with her sweet voice and deadly claws.

I worked with [Gerry Swanson](https://fromhellsheart.tumblr.com/), who designed the idea and made all of the art assets.  I was responsible for all development, and supplied game design ideas as well.

Siren Song placed 115th overall out of over 1,000 jam entries, as well as 51st in theme and 71st in innovation.
