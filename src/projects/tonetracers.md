Tonetracers is an entry in the 2014 Glitch Jam hosted on Gamejolt. Fly your glitched Tracer through four levels, using your unique glitching abilities to make your own way through. But are they so unique after all?

I came up with the overall design, created all the art, and developed all game code (including a custom game engine).  Jake Walters contributed the game music.

It placed 44th out of 94 entries.
