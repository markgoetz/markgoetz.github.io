The Divisionizer is a web app to help people explore divisions for NHL teams.  The announcement of an expansion team in Las Vegas led me to develop the application.

The original application was developed in 2011, when the team in Atlanta moved to Winnipeg but was still in the Southeast division.  I revised it in 2016 using HTML5, CSS3, Sass, React, and Webpack.
