                <p>Hi, I’m Mark Goetz and I’m a front-end developer. I’ve been interested in technology for a long time, ever since my dad took me through the computer room at the hospital he worked at. I learned programming at an early age, and earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.</p>
<p>But I realized from my experience in school and work that knowing how to build something isn’t enough. You also have to know what to build. Even though we don’t realize it, everything around us has been designed one way or the other, and how it is has been designed determines its impact. With this in mind, I decided to learn more about how technology can be designed to help people the most, and I received my Master’s degree from the University of Michigan’s School of Information, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction. After all, technology was created to serve people — not the other way around!</p>
<p>After bouncing around PHP development and UX design, I've arrived at front-end development.  I'm working for <a href="https://nerdery.com">Nerdery</a>, as a Principal Software Engineer.  I lead projects, coach other developers, and help guide the front-end domain.</p>
<p>When not turning tea into TypeScript and semantic HTML, I can be found playing board games or video games, or riding my bike.</p>
